A collection of user stories you can choose from.  Stories inside of each priority level are not necessarily in order, it's up to your group to decide how they fit into your strategy.  These are also just suggestion, feel free to change them or create your own!

## Must-Haves

> these are necessary for basic usability

- A user can see all questions at once
- A user can select an answer for each question
- A user can know which questions they got correct and incorrect
- A user can see the correct answer for questions
- A user can see their score at the end of the quiz

---

## Should-Haves

> these will complete the user experience, but are not strictly necessary

- A user can see one question at a time, stepping through the quiz (may require refactoring)
- A user can "cheat" to see the correct answer, this forfeits the question
- A user has access to resources for further study on each question
- A user can see their score update in real-time as they select answers

## Could-Haves

> would be really cool ... if there's time

- A user can modify a question in the quiz
- A user can remove questions from the quiz
- A user can add questions to the quiz
